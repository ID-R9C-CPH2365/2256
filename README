If you are like me, you'd want to have a dictionary of English language that 
"speaks". Fortunately, we have several of those on the web. Thanks to
http://www.tfd.com, for example.

The pain is, however, that you have to connect to them and go through the
entire page, click on the speaker icon to listen to the pronunciation of
the word.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could do it on command line, i.e  you say:
pronounce-the-word-whose-spelling-is <this>?

Well, your wait is over. On your Linux (*Ubuntu*) box, just do:
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-dev libsox-fmt-mp3 so you could play mp3
and ./saywhat.rb and hear your box pronounce the word as professionally
as possible ;)

Prerequisites:
1. sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev (required by nokogiri)
2. rvm gemset install nokogiri or gem install nokogiri
3. sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3
4. Make sure you are not muted ;)


Enjoy.
